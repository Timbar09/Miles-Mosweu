          <p>
            This is a simple portfolio website that I built using React. It has
            a dark mode feature and a responsive design. The website is built
            using React, Sass, and a few other libraries. The website is hosted
            on Netlify and the source code is available on GitHub. Feel free to
            use this website as a template for your own portfolio website. If
            you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me. I
            hope you like it! üòä
