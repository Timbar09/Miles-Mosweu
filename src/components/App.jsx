              <p>
                This is a simple portfolio website that I built using React. It
                has a dark mode feature and a responsive design. The website is
                built using React, Sass, and a few other libraries. The website
                is hosted on Netlify and the source code is available on GitHub.
                Feel free to use this website as a template for your own
                portfolio website. If you have any questions or suggestions,
                feel free to contact me. I hope you like it! üòä
