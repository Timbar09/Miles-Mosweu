          <p>
            I build beautiful and functional websites. I'm not only familiar
            with web design principles and best practices, but also specialize
            in building interactive web applications on the client side,
            leveraging technologies like React, SASS, Javascript, and Rails.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over the last four years, I have been grinding on my software skills
            and working with developers from all over the world on a bunch of
            cool projects. It's been a wild ride, and I've learned a lot more
            than just how to code. I've also gotten the hang of talking to
            people, working in a team, and managing my time and projects.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm always seeking growth opportunities and challenges, believing in
            continuous learning and thriving in all situations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Besides coding, I enjoy watching intellectual debates, football
            (soccer), and creating inspiring projects that benefit fellow
            developers. If you have a project in mind or a freelance
            opportunity, feel free to reach out. I'd love to hear from you! ðŸ˜Š
